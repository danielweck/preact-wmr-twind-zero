# Twind integration in Preact WMR (SSG / static SSR) with zero CSS-in-JS runtime

## Zero-runtime Twind?

The screenshots below were generated by Preact WMR's `--visualize` option (`gzip` sizes).

We use Preact WMR's built-in support for code splitting (i.e. dynamic await module import), to isolate Twind and its dependencies into their own Javascript bundle. We only load this Twind runtime code in development mode (i.e. WMR server, instant on-demand / incremental compilation of Javascript / Typescript modules), or at build time during the prerender pass (static SSR / SSG). At production runtime, the generated Twind bundle is not downloaded by the client. It stays on the server because there is no need for Twind's Just-In-Time or CSS-in-JS features. Read on for more information about the techniques used to achieve this (and their caveats).

## Background Information

* **Preact WMR** https://github.com/preactjs/wmr/
* **Twind** https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/

(original stream of consciousness in this discussion thread: https://github.com/tw-in-js/twind/discussions/147 )

The basic premise of Preact WMR's prerendering method is that each statically SSR'ed / SSG'ed HTML page is a distinct "entry point" into a complete website. Once such a content route is hydrated on the client / web browser, the page becomes a SPA inside which other routes are resolved without actual network requests to their server URLs (until the next "hard" page reload). Preact WMR's isomorphic router also supports "lazy" / dynamic component imports based on the same principle as React's Suspense (i.e. thrown Promises). The use of awaited imports enables code splitting, which consequently minimises the footprint of the initial web app "shell". Preact WMR's server-side prerender build process is capable of awaiting lazy routes in order to generate their static rendition, whilst the hydrated SPA on the client-side implements deferred code bundle fetch and execution.

Twind's principal appeal is that (unlike Tailwind) it is primarily designed for "just in time" production of a page's CSS stylesheet, based on class / token usage. Twind also offers several powerful CSS-in-JS features which help create a logical, composable and scalable organisation of component styles. By default, Twind's runtime is therefore required in web pages.

This small Preact WMR + Twind experiment demonstrates a set of techniques that achieve the following goals:

1) negate the need for Twind's client-side Javascript runtime in the HTML pages pre-rendered by Preact WMR on the server at build time (i.e. SSG / whole-site static SSR).
2) statically generate "critical" styles as an inline CSS stylesheet (i.e. in the document head), and "secondary" styles as a separate CSS stylesheet (i.e. external browser fetch, subject to HTTP cache etc.).

The CSS styles deemed "critical" are those required to render the current static route. The "secondary" stylesheet is populated with all the other styles that the SPA might need when the user navigates to another client-side route. The "critical" stylesheet is granted a high priority during the early browser loading stages, by virtue of being embedded directly in the document head. The "secondary" stylesheet (pre)loads in the background / asynchronously, to avoid blocking the main render thread. This is orchestrated by simple markup in each `index.html` route pages, and a tiny line of Javascript that signals the activation of the stylesheet so that the browser consumes it.

The obvious caveat when using this zero-runtime Twind integration recipe is that it works with dynamic class names / parameterized tokens only if they can predictably be enumerated during server-side pre-rendering. For example, if a button has "pressed" and "keyboard focused" states (aka. style variants) that can be expressed declaratively, then an enumeration of all possible states must be used to precompute the corresponding Twind classes, and to statically generate the required styles into the target stylesheet.

This repository contains a minimal demo which makes it easy to manually inspect the generated HTML / CSS / JS:

## DOCUMENTATION TODO

1) Explain how the custom Preact 'options' VNode interceptor is used to invoke Twind's `tw()` and `shortcut()` functions in "dev" mode and during Preact WMR's prerender build step, after the Twind WMR plugin has transformed tagged template literals to resolved Twind objects (that is the key technique which makes all the difference with other "static extraction" methods) Code references: https://github.com/danielweck/preact-wmr-twind-zero/blob/main/wmr-plugin-twind.mjs and https://github.com/danielweck/preact-wmr-twind-zero/blob/main/public/preact-vnode-options-hook--twind.ts and https://github.com/danielweck/preact-wmr-twind-zero/blob/main/public/preact-vnode-options-hook.ts
2) Demonstrate Suspense / lazy components, other that Preact WMR's lazy routes (i.e.dynamic imports too, but for components in the render tree within already-loaded routes).
3) Document edge cases with nested / recursive (tagged) template literals.
4) Provide an example of predictable enumeration of possible dynamic Twind classes / declarative variants, and include a technical solution in the demo (Preact Context just like in my old pre-V1 code?).

## Quick Start

* `npm install`

### Static SSR / SSG prerender:

* `npm run build` (if "segfault", try again ... this is a known Preact WMR bug with Node 16)
* `npm run serve` (web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)

### Dev server:

* `npm run start` (web browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`)
